     * ClientData to inform the observer about what exactly has happened.
     * But this convention is not required. It may still be necessary for
     * the observer to also query the subject to find out more about what has
     * happened. If this is a simple signal with no data attached,
     * or if it can safely be assumed that the observer already has a
     * reference to the subject, even the subject parameter may be null.
     * But as always this would have to be agreed to by designers of both sides.
